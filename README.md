Hi, Paolo here
--------------

- **My job**. I am an IT consultant specialized in the Observability field (Splunk, Elastic Search and the like). My drive is seeing the positive impact the results of my work have on the day-to-day job of my customers.
    I like to challenge myself with new topics and will occasionally publish stuff here if possible.
- **My job, part 2**. I lead a growing team of Splunk professionals supporting german enterprises in their journey to IT visibility. 
- **My sidejob during my job**. When I find myself in an uninteresting meeting where no real contribution from my side is necessary, you'll probably find me barely following the discussion and coding some internal tools in parallel. 
- **Some of my skills**. I am proficient in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-black?style=flat&logo=python&link=) and learning my way with ![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Golang-black?style=flat&logo=go&link=). I build my tools within ![docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-docker-black?style=flat&logo=Docker&link=) containers to be able to share them with the team. 
- **Show-off of badges**. Professionally, I am a certified Splunk Consultant, Scrum master, ITIL v4 Practitioner and Prince2 consultant.
