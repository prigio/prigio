Hi, Paolo here
--------------

- **My job**. I am an IT consultant since almost 15 years and counting. I do this because I like to challenge myself with new topics. Also, I am able to more or less pick what I do, which helps me avoid stuff I do not find interesting. 
- **My job, part 2**. I lead a growing team of Splunk professionals supporting german enterprises in their journey to IT visibility. 
- **My sidejob during my job**. When I find myself in an uninteresting meeting where no real contribution from my side is necessary, you'll probably find me barely following the discussion and coding some internal tools in parallel. 
- **Some of my skills**. I am proficient in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-black?style=flat&logo=python&link=) and learning my way with ![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Golang-black?style=flat&logo=go&link=). I build my tools within ![docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-docker-black?style=flat&logo=Docker&link=) containers to be able to share them with the team. 
- **Show-off of badges**. Professionally, I am a certified Splunk Consultant, Scrum master, ITIL Practitioner, Prince2 consultant and on my way to GCP architect certification.

Within my repos here, you'll find some really old stuffs and some newer tools I developed in recent times.
